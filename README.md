A machine learning web application that predicts whether a red wine is **acceptable** (quality ≥ 6) or **not acceptable** (quality ≤ 5) based on its physicochemical properties. The model is trained on the UCI Wine Quality dataset and deployed using Flask on Render.

## 📊 Dataset

The model uses the [Red Wine Quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from UCI. It contains 1,599 samples with 11 input features:

- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

The target variable is a binary class:
- **Acceptable** (original quality score ≥ 6)
- **Not acceptable** (original quality score ≤ 5)

## 🚀 Features

- User-friendly web interface with a clean, responsive design.
- Quick‑fill sample buttons for easy testing.
- JSON API endpoint (`/predict`) for programmatic access.
- Displays prediction and confidence score.
- Handles class imbalance using **SMOTE** during training.
- Deployed online – accessible anywhere.

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NishantDas0079/Wine-Quality-Predictor.git
cd Wine-Quality-Predictor
```

# 2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

# 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 4. Run the Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```

# Open the browser

```

# 📡 API Usage
You can also interact with the model via a JSON POST request.

Endpoint: `https://wine-quality-predictor-1-mipw.onrender.com/predict`

# 🤖 Model Training
The classifier is a Random Forest trained with SMOTE to balance the classes. Key steps:

Load and preprocess data.

Create binary target (acceptable/not acceptable).

Split into train/test sets.

Build a pipeline: `StandardScaler → SMOTE → RandomForestClassifier`.

Train and save with `joblib`.

See `train_model_binary.py` for details (if included).

# 📈 Performance
On the test set (20% holdout), the model achieves:

Accuracy: ~XX% (fill in your actual test accuracy)

Precision/Recall/F1 for each class (you can add a table if desired)
